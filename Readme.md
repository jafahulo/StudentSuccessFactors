# WGU Data Analytics Capstone Project
## Introduction
Throughout my time at WGU I have learned several skills to become successful. In my personal experience, 
I've seen that pacing myself, allowing time for fun, and setting goals has been hugely influential to my success.

In this capstone project I will analyze a dataset of student performance factors and exam scores found on Kaggle.com 
(Courtesy of [lainguyn123](https://www.kaggle.com/lainguyn123)).

The purpose of this project is to display skills I have learned while earning my bachelors degree. I will apply statistical
analysis to understand correlations between student behavior and their exam scores.

## Hypothesis Statement:
What Is the top contributer to high and low exam scores? Are they the same?
